  - **Unit Test**: Test that covers a subset of the code.  This is often a single function. There are occasions when a hook is provided to get at a private function to simplify testing.
  - **Integration Test**: A test that covers multiple layers of the service. Often utilizing the database to allow for more complete tests. These tests should use mocks sparingly.
